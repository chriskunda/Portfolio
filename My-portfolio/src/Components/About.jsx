            <p>Hi! I’m Chris, a passionate and creative front-end developer who loves turning ideas into <br />
                clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I’m currently building my skills in HTML, CSS, <br />
                and React, with a strong interest in creating smooth layouts and engaging user <br />
                experiences. I enjoy learning new design trends, experimenting with animations, and <br />
                improving my code every day. My goal is to grow into a professional front-end developer <br />
